# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 

With version control you can view the history of revisions for files: who made them, when they were made, and merge revisions made by different people. It's useful because it allows you to go back to prior revisions if mistakes were made or the repository breaks.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a useful tool in git that allows the user to literally branch off of the repository and make edits/add and change files without breaking anything in the main 'master' repository.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is basically a save point in git. It also logs the save author/time stamp. A good commit message lets other users know what changes were commited.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when there are prior condition(s) that must be met before merging two branches together. This could be something as simple as not having commit a change, or a complicated multi file code breaker.
