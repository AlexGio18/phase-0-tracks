<h1> Hello, Doggie! </h1>
<p> This page is about <strong>DOGS!</strong> Here is a list of things that dogs are.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dogs are little wolf shaped pets! Except they are better than wolves.</li>
	<li> Dogs communicate through barks and stuff.</li>
	<li> Dogs don't sweat. Instead, they pant a lot.</li>
	<li> Dogs tend to wag their tail when they are excited or happy!</li>
</ul>
